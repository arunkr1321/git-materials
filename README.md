# Mastering Git: Materials

> **NOTE**: This book has now been deprecated. You can still learn about `git` in the two new git books: **[Git Apprentice](https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/git-apprentice)** and **[Advanced Git](https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/advanced-git)**.

This repo contains all the downloadable materials and projects associated with the **Mastering Git** from [raywenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com).

Each edition has its own branch, named `editions/[EDITION]`. The default branch for this repo is for the most recent edition.
