Chapter 16 — Challenge Solution

This challenge is rather straightforward:

Go back and remove all traces of **IGNORE_ME** from your repository.

You previously removed all traces of **IGNORE_ME** from your repository, but that took you two steps. The challenge here is to do that in one single command:

- Use `git filter-branch`
- Use `--index-filter` to rewrite the index
- You can use a similar `git rm` command, but remember, this time, you’re filtering on a different file.
- Use `--prune-empty` to remove any empty commits.
- Remember that you want to apply this to all commits, starting at `HEAD` and going backwards.
- You’ll need to use `-f` to force this `filter-branch` operation, since you’ve already done a `filter-branch` and Git has stored a backup of that operation for you.

Quite simply, you can reuse almost the same command you did to remove all traces of the SECRETS file:

git filter-branch -f --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch -- IGNORE_ME' --prune-empty HEAD

The only difference here is that you’ve run the "git rm" command against IGNORE_ME, and you’ve added the "--prune-empty" option as well.
