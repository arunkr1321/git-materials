Chapter 13 — Challenge Solution

This challenge simply reuses the commands you’ve already learned in this chapter to accomplish the following tasks:

- Checkout the `xReadmeUpdates` branch and look at the README.md file to see Xanthe’s version.
- Checkout `master`, since this is the destination for your merge.
- Resolve any merge conflicts by hand.
- Stage your changes.
- Commit your changes.
- Delete the `xReadmeUpdates` branch.

Here are the steps I followed to complete this challenge; your solution may be slightly different:

1. Checkout the branch with the command: git checkout xReadmeUpdates
2. Look at the file with the following command: cat README.md.
3. I can see that the file is pretty basic, with the simple information about the library and page, and some contact information below.
4. Switch to the master branch with the command: git checkout master
5. Run the merge with the command: git merge xReadmeUpdates
6. Git tells me there’s a merge conflict, so I open up README.md in a text editor.
7. I see the following contents in README.md:


# magicSquareJS

8. It appears someone has added license and maintainer information along the way, and Xanthe has added the contact information in a separate branch. Git sees this as a conflict because both authors added the text at the exact same place: the end of the file. Git doesn’t know anything about the semantics of this file, so it bails and asks you to manually correct the conflict.
9. I want to keep both sets of changes, so I remove the following line: <<<<<<< HEAD
10. I also remove: ||||||| merged common ancestors
11. I also remove: =======
12. I also remove: >>>>> xReadmeUpdates
13. I save my work and exit out of the text editor.
14. I add my changes with the command: git add README.md
15. I commit my changes with the command: git commit
16. I use ":wq" to exit out of Vim and accept the default merge commit message.
17. I delete the xReadmeUpdates branch with the command: git branch -d xReadmeUpdates
